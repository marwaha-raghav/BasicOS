# JackalOS

## 1. What is this?
JackalOS is an attempt to better understand the working of simple GUI based operating systems, by creating one!  
It is built using the [COSMOS toolkit](https://www.gocosmos.org/) and is typed in C#.

## 2. Currently Working Features:
* Basic GUI, with a proper functioning mouse.
* Working text rendering, with all lower-case characters and numbers.
* Paint Application.

## 3. Features under active development (Coming Soon)
* FAT File System.
* Support for upper-case characters and more symbols.
* Support for different brush-sizes in Paint Application.

## 4. Known Issues
* Slow mouse movement when hovering over text menu's
* Mouse when moved over text(in Notepad), drawing(in Paint) erases it.
* ~Backspace in Notepad doesn't erase more than one character.~ [FIXED]

## 5. How to run?
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.  
2. Open using [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) which has COSMOS userkit/devkit installed.  
3. Build the project and it should execute as a virtual machine.
